# castagogue
RSS generator for faith-based organizations with relatively stable event calendars.

# roadmap
1 - generate continuing feed from existing file
2 - upload rss file to given location and filename
3 - create new feed file from input parameters
4 - read %tokens% from daily.txt to allow randomized lists of media (Proverb of the Day, etc.)?
5 - upload attached media to file server
6 - pretty GUI to make editing day files easier

# config files
monday.txt, etc - every Monday
tuesday2.txt, etc - 2nd Tuesday of each month
date15.txt - 15th of each month
daily.txt - every day (see roadmap 4)
