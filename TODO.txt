# TODO:
Take input of two dates.
Run through each date from the first to the last (inclusive)
For each date, determine the day of the week and the week of the month.
Run day.txt and daywknum.txt and dayodd/dayeven.txt.
Publish RSS file.

Fix error that results in failure to delete some old items.
Make sure I didn't reinvent the wheel with my row processing (might be better to have used RRGroup).
